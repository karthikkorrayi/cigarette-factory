Build and publish custom pipeline task extensions in Azure DevOps

So, here I created an extension as Azure VM
..........................................................................................................

Here's the folder structured need to be remembered,

	StorageAccount
	|- buildreleasetask
	|	|-- node_modules
	|	|-- .gitignore
	|	|-- index.ts
	|	|-- package-lock.json
	|	|-- package.json
	|	|-- task.json
	|	|-- tsconfig.json
	|- images
	|- LICENSE
	|- README.md
	|- vss-extension.json


..........................................................................................................

According to the structured to get, 
I created a folder with name - "StorageAccount" as the main one,
under that,
	create a folders - buildreleasetask, images and all



------->> STEP-1

	inside the buildandreleasetask, 
	run the following commands in the terminal
		> npm init --yes
		> npm install azure-pipelines-task-lib --save
		> npm install @types/node --save-dev
		> npm install @types/q --save-dev
		> echo node_modules>.gitignore
		> npm install typescript@4.6.3 --save-dev



------->> STEP-2: create main files

	Create a task.json, index.ts files in the buildandreleasetask folder
	
    copy and paste the code as there in the same directory as I uploaded
	and convert the index.ts to index.js that can be generate new one by giving command
		> tsc index.ts

	and create tsconfig.json compiler options by giving the command
		> tsc --init --target es6



------->> STEP-3: create json file for extension

	Create a file vss-extension.json file in src folder add all the required fields
	and paste the code as there in the same directory as I uploaded
	
	and the most important placeholder is the taskguid, 
	and it must be unique. 
	To generate GUID use the below code in powershell 
	and copy paste in task.json and vss-extension.json
		> (New-Guid).Guid



------->> STEP-4: Create extension

	Package the extension using command: 
		> tfx extension create --manifest-globs vss-extension.json
	This will create an extension file which is of format .vsix



------->> STEP-5: Publish extension

	Go to your publisher profile if not created, 
	create a publisher here: Create/Manage publisher
	
	After navigating to your publisher profile click on “New extension”,
	Select Azure DevOps and upload .vsix file which is packaged earlier.

	This will validate the extension and once validation succeeded 
	you can edit or share the extension by Right-click your extension.

If we're running through local,
better use the following formats,

$env:LOCAL="true"
$env:SUBSCRIPTION_ID="23tty..."
$env:CLIENT_ID="4t665uhymj67i..."
$env:SECRET="6hyyhnyu-..."
$env:TENANT_ID="ad534rgbm..."
$env:RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME="RG-DEVOPS-EXPLORE"
$env:STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME="storageaccnamedemo"

Make sure to check with code if we're runing through local,
which mean that the az subscription details and authentications were not involved here
