            <h2>ITC Next!</h2>
            <p>An extensive strategy reset has been undertaken to architect the structural drivers that will power ITC's next horizon of growth and ensure that the enterprise remains future-oriented, consumer-centric and nimble. Each of your Company's businesses has pivoted to create new frontiers for the future, with enhanced competitiveness as well as sharper focus on cost management to strengthen leadership or rapidly attain the top positions in the case of newer segments. This is reflected in your Company's resilient performance last year despite the disruptions, as well as in the 3 years prior to the pandemic, with EPS growing by 47%. Return on Segment Capital Employed also moved up from 61% to 72% in the same period.

                As a core element of the ITC Next strategy, your Company will continue to explore opportunities to craft disruptive business models anchored at the intersection of Digital and Sustainability, the two defining trends in the 'new normal', leveraging its institutional strengths. Let me highlight some of the contours of this ITC Next strategy.
                
                Winning the Future with Digital Transformation
                
                At ITC, we recognise that enterprises must possess distinctive digital capabilities to win the future. Your Company is therefore pursuing an accelerated journey to build a dynamic 'FutureTech' enterprise by investing in cutting-edge digital technologies to shape a new paradigm of competitiveness, create innovative business models and tap newer opportunities.</p>
